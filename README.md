# ph-payroll-mcp

An MCP server that gives any MCP-compatible LLM accurate, current-year Philippine
statutory payroll math — SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and BIR withholding tax — instead
of guessing from stale training data. Every number is computed from versioned reference
tables and cited to its source circular.

## Why this exists

Philippine contribution brackets change yearly via agency circulars. LLMs either
hallucinate plausible-looking numbers or answer with last year's rates, stated with total
confidence. This server does the arithmetic correctly and cites the source circular for
every number, so the answer is auditable rather than a black box.

MCP is an open standard, not a Claude-specific feature — this server works with any MCP
client: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, and more.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `compute_sss_contribution` | SSS contribution by MSC bracket + member type (incl. WISP/MPF layer above MSC ₱20,000) |
| `compute_philhealth_contribution` | PhilHealth premium (5% split, floor/ceiling) |
| `compute_pagibig_contribution` | Pag-IBIG (HDMF) contribution |
| `compute_withholding_tax` | BIR period-based Revised Withholding Tax (monthly to start) |
| `compute_13th_month_pay` | 13th month pay + tax-exempt portion |
| `compute_net_pay` | Full monthly payslip: gross → net |
| `get_contribution_table` | Raw bracket table + effective date + source circular |

## Data sources

Contribution tables are versioned by effective date and stored in
`config/contribution_tables/`, each carrying its `effective_date` and `source_circular`.
Next year's update is a data PR, not a code change. Every table is verified against the
primary agency circular (sss.gov.ph, philhealth.gov.ph, pagibigfund.gov.ph, bir.gov.ph)
before shipping.

## Disclaimer

This tool is provided for informational and educational purposes only. Statutory
contribution and tax figures are computed from published agency reference tables and may
contain errors or lag official changes. It is **not** professional tax, legal, or payroll
advice. Verify every figure against the cited source circular and the relevant agency
before relying on it for actual remittance or filing.
